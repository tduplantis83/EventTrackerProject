## Douglas County, CO Events

### Skill Distillery Assignment
Course Began: 9/9/19

Assigned: 11/27/19

Completed: 11/29/19

Built by:
* [Travis Duplantis](https://github.com/tduplantis83)

* [Project Requirements](https://github.com/tduplantis83/EventTrackerProject/blob/master/PROJECTREQUIREMENTS.md)

* [REST Route Mapping & HTTP Methods](https://github.com/tduplantis83/EventTrackerProject/blob/master/RouteMapping.pdf)

* [AWS Deployed Event Tracker](http://18.190.145.109:8080/EventTracker/api/events)

### Overview:
This program is designed to be a simple event tracker, utilizing Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and RestAPI. As assigned, the project currently has no front-end.

### How to run:
This application is not designed with any front-end. Instead, it may be run within the Spring Tool Suite IDE. Within the IDE, the user may run all JUnit 5 test cases. The user may also verify mappings function correctly by utilizing Postman.

The application has also been deployed to AWS on an EC2 instance. It can be run there by accessing the above described REST Route Mappings at [AWS Deployed Event Tracker](http://18.190.145.109:8080/EventTracker/api/events).


### Technologies used:

Java, Java Persistence API, Spring MVC & STS, Gradle, SQL, MySQL Workbench, Atom, Git, GitHub, Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot, RestAPI, JSON, & Postman

### Topics implemented:

RestFul Services

Spring Data JPA

Data Serialization

HTTP Request & Response Objects

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

Relational Database: SQL Database creation using MySQL Workbench.

Java Libraries: SQL, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT 5 Juniper.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of REST, Spring Data JPA, and HTTP Request and Response Objects. Over the course of the assignment I:
* Built a single-table database & populated it using MySQL Workbench.
* Utilized version tracking via Git/GitHub
* Understand Spring (Boot & Data JPA)
* Understand RESTAPI & URI naming schema
