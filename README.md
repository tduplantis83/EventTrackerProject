# Event Tracker Project

## Douglas County, CO Events

### Skill Distillery Assignment
Course Began: 9/9/19

Assigned: 12/13/19

Completed: 12/15/19

Built by:
* [Travis Duplantis](https://github.com/tduplantis83)

* [Project Requirements](https://github.com/SkillDistillery/SD23/blob/master/angular/eventTracker/README.md)

* [REST Route Mapping & HTTP Methods](https://github.com/tduplantis83/EventTrackerProject/blob/master/RouteMapping.pdf)

* [AWS Deployed Event Tracker](http://18.190.145.109:8080/EventTracker/)

### Overview:
This program is designed to be a simple event tracker, utilizing Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, RestAPI, with a DOM-traversing Angular front-end.

### How to run:
Initially this application was not designed with any front-end. Instead, it was to be run within the Spring Tool Suite IDE. Within the IDE, the user could also run all JUnit 5 test cases. The user may also verify mappings function correctly by utilizing Postman.

The application has since been updated with and Angular front-end and deployed to AWS on an EC2 instance. It can be run there by accessing the above described REST Route Mappings at [AWS Deployed Event Tracker](http://18.190.145.109:8080/EventTracker/api/events).


### Technologies used:

Java, Java Persistence API, Spring MVC & STS, Gradle, SQL, MySQL Workbench, Atom, Git, GitHub, Postman, Spring Data JPA, Spring Boot, RestAPI, JSON, TypeScript, Angular

### Topics implemented:

RestFul Services

Spring Data JPA

Data Serialization

HTTP Request & Response Objects

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

Relational Database: SQL Database creation using MySQL Workbench.

Java Libraries: SQL, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT 5 Juniper.

TypeScript

Angular front-end with DOM traversal

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of REST, Spring Data JPA, and HTTP Request and Response Objects. Over the course of the assignment I:
* Built a single-table database & populated it using MySQL Workbench.
* Utilized version tracking via Git/GitHub
* Understand Spring (Boot & Data JPA)
* Understand RESTAPI & URI naming schema
* Better understand DOM traversal
* Gained a firm grasp of TypeScript
